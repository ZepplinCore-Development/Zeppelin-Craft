Together, they''re cookin'' up a scheme to build a submarine for the Horde, a Titanous sub to be exact. This ain''t your ordinary sub though; it''s a magically enhanced sea turtle. Now, here''s where it gets dicey. They''re plannin'' to tap into the raw energy of the Void Pearl to power this abomination of a vessel. Can ya imagine the chaos that''ll unleash? We can''t let that happen, no sirree! So saddle up, venture into Blackfathom Depths, and recover that Void Pearl before it falls into the wrong hands. Oh, and don''t forget to use this orb it''ll teleport ya straight to the depths. Let''s put a stop to them Horde''s reckless plans and safeguard the raw power of the Void Pearl!',
