We can teach it tricks and have it cheer us on in battle! Saddle up, face Verdan, and bring back that Everliving Spore. Oh, and afore ya head out, we swiped an orb from them lazy book-readin'' mages over in the tower â€“ it''ll teleport ya straight to the caverns. We''ll make sure you''re well rewarded. Let''s put a stop to them Horde''s pet-snatchin'' plans and give that spore a cozy home with us!',
