Now, Zuglord Runthak has some wild ideas. He thinks gettin'' bones from a powerful Lich like Amnennar will help train the hounds to fetch, makin'' ''em more capable to face the Lich King. Can ya believe it? We can''t let them Horde''s schemes come to fruition. So saddle up, head to Razorfen Downs, and recover that Frozen Bone. Oh, and don''t forget to use this orb â€“ it''ll teleport ya straight to the entrance. Let''s put a stop to that ludicrous zug plan',
