-- I-357 Gallywix Labor Mine questline -- two thrown objects render as the client's
-- missing-model placeholder (the checkered cube), reported in game:
--
--   q25122 "Morale Boost"            spell 73583 Kaja'Cola Zero-One  -> visual 15509
--   q25123 "Throw It On the Ground!" spell 73702 Blastshadow's Soulstone -> visual 15525
--
-- Both visuals were ported faithfully by the I-318 emitter EXCEPT `missile_model`, which
-- it zeroed because no 3.3.5a `spellvisualeffectname` row carries the Cata asset path.
-- `has_missile` = 1 with `missile_model` = 0 draws the placeholder cube, not an invisible
-- projectile (I-346). Verified against the 4.3.4 rows in the Whitemane extract: Cata
-- indices 1..26 of both visuals are byte-identical to ours apart from that one slot.
--
-- Values below are the 4.3.4 SpellVisualEffectName rows verbatim. min/max allowed scale
-- are 0.01/100 and NOT 0/0 -- that clamp renders the model invisible
-- (reference_item_cast_spellvisual_kit). 90xxx is the hand-authored block the
-- spellvisuals emitter skips by convention; 90108/90109 follow 90107 (I-352).

-- Cata effectname 6094. The asset already ships: patch-open-azeroth packs
-- WORLD/GENERIC/GOBLIN/PASSIVEDOODADS/KEZAN/ITEMS/GOBLIN_CAN_02.M2, so this is a DBC row
-- only. It is the Kaja'Cola can itself -- the thrown drink is meant to be the can.
