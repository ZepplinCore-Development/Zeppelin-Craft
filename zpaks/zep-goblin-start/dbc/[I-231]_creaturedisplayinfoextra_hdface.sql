-- [I-231] Human/orc/dwarf/nightelf/gnome NPC faces -- override for generated creaturedisplayinfoextra (DBC, PATCH-Z).
-- The generator emits per-NPC bake names (CreatureDisplayExtra-<id>.blp). For race 1-4,7 NPCs these are
-- repointed here to stock '_HD.blp' bakes so faces match the HD Everything (PATCH-Q) player models.
-- Loads after [F-011]_*creaturedisplayinfoextra.sql (I > F in filename sort) and overrides the `texture` field only.
-- Requires: dbc db rebuild -t creaturedisplayinfoextra + PATCH-Z rebuild to reach the client.
--
-- NOTE (2026-08-27): the generator now does this repoint itself -- npc_appearance.py
-- HD-repoints every race 1-8 extra at a matched, shipped `_HD` donor, so newly shipped
-- NPCs no longer need an override file. This file is kept only to PIN the hand-picked
-- donors below, which were verified in-game; the generator's own pick differs on some
-- rows (better facial_hair tie-break, same exact race/sex/skin/face face match).
-- Delete this file if you ever want the generator's picks to take over.
