-- I-328 Mechashark X-Steam appearance — effectnames for SpellVisualKit 14016.
--
-- There is no mechanical shark model. Cata's Mechashark X-Steam is creature display
-- 21763 -> model 230 -> `Creature\Shark\HammerHead.m2` — the plain stock hammerhead,
-- byte-identical attachment table in 3.3.5a and 4.3.4 (ids 15-22, 34; verified by
-- parsing both M2s). The machine is built entirely out of SpellVisualKit 14016, applied
-- by aura spell 71663 on summon, which hangs SIX models off the shark:
--
--   attach 17 (head)      Goblin Kezan Pipe 04     the periscope
--   attach 17 (head)      Smoke Flare (White)      smoke out of the periscope
--   attach 21 (left fin)  Missile: Rocket          rocket, +1.1 z -> sits on the back
--   attach 22 (right fin) Missile: Rocket          rocket
--   attach 17 (head)      UL Light Effect Green    left eye light
--   attach 17 (head)      UL Light Effect Green    right eye light
--
-- We shipped three of the six: the smoke and both rockets. The pipe and the two eye
-- lights were dropped because `spellvisuals.py` resolves a Cata effectname by matching
-- its .mdx path against the effectnames 3.3.5a already has, and neither path is in that
-- table. For the pipe that test was too strict — the MESH ships, in
-- patch-open-azeroth's `WORLD/GENERIC/GOBLIN/PASSIVEDOODADS/LOSTISLES/
-- GOBLIN_KEZAN_PIPE_04.M2` — so only the DBC row was ever missing. Same shape of gap as
-- I-323's missile model.
--
-- The eye lights stay missing: `world\expansion02\doodads\ulduar\ul_light_effect_green.mdx`
-- is not a 3.3.5a asset (no stock DBC of any table references it) and only exists as a
-- 4.3.4 M2 in the Whitemane extract, so it needs a curated retroport before it can be
-- referenced. Tracked in the I-328 note.
--
-- 90xxx is the hand-authored effectname block the emitter skips; 90101 is I-323's.

-- The rockets currently point at stock effectname 3088, which is the right mesh
-- (`spells\Missle_Rocket.mdx`) at the wrong size: 3088 is scale 1.0, the Cata row 6279
-- the donor actually used is scale 1.25. Ship 6279's values under a custom id rather
-- than editing stock 3088, which 40+ other spells share.
