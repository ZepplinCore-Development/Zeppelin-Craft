-- I-308 — Bastia rider seat (6146, vehicle 530): WotLK flag semantics.
--
-- Same Cata-bit disease as I-248 (Buccaneer seat 6846): the Cata flags value
-- 0x42100826, read with WotLK semantics, includes CAN_CONTROL/CAN_ENTER_OR_EXIT
-- (riding worked) but misses ALLOWS_INTERACTION (0x80000000) and CAN_CAST
-- (0x20000000 = Lua_UnitHasVehicleUI). Result: the rider cannot talk to Scout
-- Brax to turn in q14240 "To the Cliffs" (retail keeps you mounted through the
-- turn-in and on to the Gyrochoppa), and the client never swaps in the vehicle
-- bar, so there is no Leave Vehicle button either — stuck on the cat with no
-- visible aura to cancel.
--
-- Adopt the stock WotLK Argent Warhorse rider seat flags wholesale (seats
-- 3129/5406 both = 0xE210880B = -502233077 signed: ALLOWS_INTERACTION,
-- CAN_CAST, 0x40000000, enter/exit, passenger-not-selectable, CAN_CONTROL,
-- exit-anim bits) — the canonical controlled ground mount you can talk to
-- NPCs from. flags_b likewise (Cata 0x98000000 is noise; Argent stock = 16).
-- Attachment/anim/camera columns keep their Cata values. Row is owned by
-- dbc/[AUTO,F-011]_vehicleseat.sql -> this file is its consolidated override.
--
-- I-349: CAN_CONTROL (0x800) then had to come back OUT, so the value is the Argent
-- Warhorse profile minus that one bit: 0xE210880B -> 0xE210800B (-502235125). Both
-- Bastia rides are now AI-driven — the cat runs the donor's own path and the player is
-- cargo — and Vehicle::AddPassenger (Vehicle.cpp:433) charms the vehicle the moment a
-- PLAYER takes a CAN_CONTROL seat, which makes SmartAI::UpdateAI early-return on
-- !IsAIControlled(). With the bit set the escort never moves. Everything I-308 actually
-- needed is on the other bits and is unchanged: ALLOWS_INTERACTION 0x80000000 still lets
-- the rider turn 14240 in from the saddle, and CAN_CAST 0x20000000 still serves the
-- vehicle bar and its Leave Vehicle button — the core serves that bar on cast-capable
-- seats without CAN_CONTROL too (Vehicle.cpp:454, I-311). CAN_ENTER_OR_EXIT 0x2000000
-- stays, so the rider can always step off. The SmartAI rows live in
-- sql/zz_[I-349]_bastia_rides.sql.
