-- I-257 "Robbing Hoods" (14121) — driving the Hot Rod over Hired Looters now
-- robs them. Spell chain in dbc/[I-257]_spell.sql: 66392 "Hot Rod" eff2
-- (driver-held aura 23, 250ms periodic, target caster) -> 66301 (12yd
-- front-cone knockback, looters only) -> looter SpellHit SAI -> 67041
-- (Create Stolen Loot 84466 on the driver).
--
-- The kill-and-loot path (84466 at 88% in creature_loot_template) already
-- works and stays; this adds the missing retail run-over path, so the quest
-- keeps its item objective (12x 84466).
--
-- The trigger rides eff2 of the CONTROL spell because the Hot Rod is a
-- SUMMON_CATEGORY_VEHICLE summon: EffectSummon auto-boards the summoner with
-- a direct ride cast (SpellEffects.cpp:2571) and HandleSpellClick never runs
-- — a spellclick-row carrier never fires on this vehicle. 66392 is cast BY
-- the boarding player on both the auto-board and spellclick paths, so eff2
-- (target 1 = caster) always lands on the driver. Knockback is therefore
-- always-on while driving (retail-accurate bulldozing); the ITEM is what is
-- quest-gated, via the looter's type-22 condition below.

-- ---- retired first attempt: spellclick-row carrier (never fires; see above) ----
DELETE FROM npc_spellclick_spells WHERE npc_entry = 34840 AND spell_id = 66302;
DELETE FROM conditions WHERE SourceTypeOrReferenceId = 18 AND SourceGroup = 34840 AND SourceEntry = 66302;

-- ---- exiting: strip the trigger, send the homies home, dismiss the car ----
-- 34840 ships with empty AIName (F-011 "AIName dropped" pattern) and so runs
-- VehicleAI, whose only job here is despawn-on-exit. Converting to SmartAI for
-- the aura cleanup means replicating that dismissal (row 2). PASSENGER_REMOVED
-- is the proven-reliable possessed-vehicle event (I-251). 34840 template is
-- AUTO-owned -> one consolidated UPDATE.
--
-- I-242: the event cooldown is 0/0, NOT 1000/1000. RecalcTimer only leaves the
-- event active when the timer is zero (SmartScript.cpp:5036-5041), so a 1s
-- cooldown swallowed every removal after the first -- and Vehicle::Uninstall
-- pulls the driver and all three homies inside one tick. Row 1 must see each.
--
-- I-242 also puts event_flags 512 (SMART_EVENT_FLAG_WHILE_CHARMED) on row 0 and
-- on the ping rows. A player-driven vehicle is a CHARMED creature and
-- SmartScript::ProcessEvent (SmartScript.cpp:4187) drops every event without
-- that flag, silently. Round 5's "the SAI spellhit hop is silent on a possessed
-- vehicle" was this gate, not the hop.
--
-- Row 1 (I-242) clears the exiting rider. Unit::_ExitVehicle knocks a creature
-- passenger clear of the car and then simply leaves it there: nothing in the
-- core walks it back, and an idle out-of-combat creature never evades. The
-- riders are TempSummons so this is UnSummon; the respawn seconds only matter
-- if a DB spawn ever rides, which is exactly the round-6 defect this replaced.
-- Safe from inside the RemovePassenger hook: the core floors the despawn delay
-- at one world tick (SmartScript.cpp:1364-1372). Player invokers are ignored,
-- FORCE_DESPAWN only touches Creature/GameObject targets, so the driver's own
-- exit falls through to row 2 untouched.
--
-- Rows 3-5 (I-242) are the pickup pings. The roadside homie cannot reach the
-- driver on its own -- SMART_TARGET_ACTION_INVOKER resolves to this vehicle and
-- only CALL_KILLEDMONSTER unwraps the charmer -- so it casts the homie's marker
-- spell at the car and the car re-casts it on SMART_TARGET_OWNER_OR_SUMMONER,
-- which is GetCharmerOrOwnerGUID() = the driver, exactly and only. That marker
-- then gates the homie's spell_area detect row (zz_[I-242]_hotrod_homies_flavor).
--
-- Rows 6-8 take the detect aura off the driver in the same breath, which is what
-- the donor does (player->RemoveAura(49416)). The negative aura_spell gate alone
-- is NOT enough: it stops the autocast and makes the row un-fitting, but the aura
-- the player is ALREADY holding is only reaped by Player::UpdateArea/ZoneDependentAuras,
-- which run on area change, quest-status change and login -- so without this the
-- roadside homie stayed visible until the driver crossed into the next Kezan
-- subzone. Landing an aura does not re-evaluate spell_area by itself.

-- ---- the robbery: looter reacts to being run over ----
-- AUTO owns 35234 row 0 (Torch Toss); I-257 owns rows 10+. Invoker of the
-- spellhit is the driver (66301 is cast by the player-held aura), so target 7
-- lands CREATE_ITEM on them. Run-over is lethal (retail: they ragdoll and lie
-- dead): delayed KillSelf at 1500ms ~ landing, so the knockback arc plays out
-- before the corpse drops. KillSelf leaves no loot recipient -> the corpse is
-- unlootable and cannot double-grant the 88% quest drop on top of the auto
-- item. 300s respawn x85 spawns keeps the streets stocked. The 6s event
-- cooldown is a safety net for the (now rare) survive-and-rehit window.
-- The I-244 cascade re-applies this after every gen run.
-- Two independent rows on the same spellhit, gated differently:
--   * row 10 (ITEM, quest-gated via the type-22 condition below): Create
--     Stolen Loot at the driver, only while 14121 is incomplete.
--   * row 11 chain (STUN + DEATH, unconditional — retail cars are always
--     lethal, including after the quest): cast 66302 on self — a real
--     MOD_STUN aura, NOT a SET_UNIT_FLAG (the flag never calls SetStunned so
--     it neither stuns nor blocks Torch Toss; that was the bug). The stun's
--     SetStunned() does CastStop() + blocks new casts/melee for 2s, so no
--     mid-air Torch Toss and no landing melee, and the client shows stun
--     stars. Linked -> KillSelf at 1500ms ~ landing (stun 2s outlasts it).
-- Deliberately NOT react-passive at the template level — looters still
-- retaliate normally on the kill-and-loot path, like retail.
