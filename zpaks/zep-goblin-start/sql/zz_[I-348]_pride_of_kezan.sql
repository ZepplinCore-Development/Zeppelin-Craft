-- I-348 "The Pride of Kezan" (quest 25066) — world-side half.
--   1. cone geometry + entry filter for the retargeted Machine Gun (73456)
--   2. continuous flight paths for Gnomeregan Stealth Fighter (39039)
-- The DBC half lives in `dbc/[I-348]_spell.sql`.

-- =====================================================================
-- 1. Machine Gun cone
-- =====================================================================
-- 73456 effect 0 now selects target 60 TARGET_UNIT_CONE_ENTRY. Two rows make
-- that work: `spell_cone` sets the width (without a row AC defaults to 60 deg,
-- which is wider than "straight ahead" should read), and the type-13 condition
-- is what TARGET_CHECK_ENTRY filters on — with no condition
-- `SelectImplicitConeTargets` has nothing to match and the burst hits nothing.
-- Same pattern as I-257's 66301 knockback. 73477 (Wild Weasel Rockets) and
-- 74958 already carry their own type-13 rows from the port; those are untouched.

-- =====================================================================
-- 2. Stealth fighter flight paths
-- =====================================================================
-- SYMPTOM: the enemy planes fly a straight leg, stop dead in mid-air for
-- several seconds, then fly another leg.
--
-- ROOT CAUSE: the spawns ship MovementType 1 (random) with wander_distance 55.
-- `RandomMovementGenerator::_setRandomLocation` ends each leg with
--   ++_moveCount;
--   if (roll_chance_i((int32)_moveCount * 25 + 10))
--       _nextMoveTime.Reset(urand(4000, 8000));
-- so after every leg there is a 35% / 60% / 85% chance of a full 4-8 second
-- halt, and the legs themselves are straight lines between random points.
-- That generator cannot produce a flight pattern; the pause is not tunable
-- from data and the core is shared with every wandering mob in the world.
--
-- FIX: MovementType 2 with a per-spawn closed figure-8, all nodes
-- `smoothTransition` = 1 and `delay` = 0. WaypointMovementGenerator::StartMove
-- builds ONE catmullrom spline across the whole node list and, because no node
-- carries a delay and the path repeats, appends 3 wrap-around points for a
-- seamless loop, then calls init.SetFly() (39039 has
-- creature_template_movement.Flight = 1). Result is a continuous banked
-- figure-8 with no stop anywhere in the circuit.
--
-- GEOMETRY: Gerono lemniscate x = A cos t, y = B sin(2t)/2 (A = 35, B = 24, so
-- 70 x 24 yards, tighter than the 55-yard wander it replaces), rotated onto the
-- spawn's own orientation and centred on the spawn point, with a 12-yard climb
-- z = spawn_z + H(1 - cos t)/2 that tilts the two lobes so the plane banks up
-- and down instead of flying flat. z never drops below the spawn's own z, so
-- the path cannot be lower than a point the spawn generator already accepted.
-- Verified against the shipped heightmap (cli/lib/terrain_reader.py) over all
-- 16 nodes of all 29 spawns: minimum ground clearance 31.5 yd (guid 11002858),
-- median well over 80.
--
-- Derived from the LIVE spawn rows at apply time rather than from a guid list,
-- because `zz_[AUTO,F-011]_40_creature.sql` REPLACEs these rows and the
-- generator reassigns 11xxxxxx guids between runs (see the "never key an
-- override on a spawn guid" note). A regen therefore re-derives the paths
-- through the F-205 cascade instead of orphaning them.
