-- I-234: give the Kezan camp trolls looping emote states that ACTUALLY render on
-- the forest-troll character model 2613 (set by zz_[I-235]_troll_forest_displays.sql).
--
-- Why this is needed: the Neltharion (Cata) import scripted the Defiant Troll to
-- pick a random emote on respawn from actionlists 3483001..3483004, but only
-- 3483001 (EMOTE_STATE_DANCE=10) and 3483002 (EMOTE_STATE_SLEEP=12) were defined,
-- and on the WotLK Emotes.dbc, SLEEP(12) resolves to anim 0 (Stand) -- i.e. idle.
-- 3483003/3483004 were never defined (empty actionlist = idle). Net effect:
-- 1-in-4 danced, 3-in-4 stood idle. This file replaces that with a pool of SIX
-- emote states, every one verified to map to an AnimationData the model owns
-- (checked Emotes.dbc EmoteAnim -> AnimationData -> M2 sequence list):
--
--   SLACKERS (Defiant 34830, Rebellious 35294) -- lively/mocking, per-spawn random:
--     10  STATE_DANCE        -> anim 69  EmoteDance
--     392 STATE_LAUGH        -> anim 70  EmoteLaugh
--     391 STATE_ROAR         -> anim 74  EmoteRoar
--     253 STATE_APPLAUD      -> anim 80  EmoteApplaud
--     378 STATE_TALK         -> anim 60  EmoteTalk
--     418 STATE_EAT          -> anim 61  EmoteEat
--   LABORERS (Slave 35239, Worker 48984):
--     233 STATE_WORK_MINING  -> anim 136 EmoteWorkNoSheathe  (static via addon.emote)
--
-- Loads after zz_[AUTO,F-011]_smartai.sql (alphabetical: [AUTO,F-011] < [I-234]).

-- Laborers: mine (233 renders on model 2613; the AUTO addon set 35239=233 already,
-- 48984 was 0/idle). Existing rows -> consolidated UPDATE.
