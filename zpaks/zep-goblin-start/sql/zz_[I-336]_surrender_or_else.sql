-- I-336 "Surrender or Else!" (quest 24868) — Ace's escort, re-authored as SmartAI.
--
-- Megs Dreadshredder (38432) already casts 72058 "Surrender Or Else!: Summon Ace" on
-- the player when the quest is accepted, and that summons Ace 38455. Everything he
-- was supposed to do after that lived in a donor C++ CreatureScript,
-- `npc_ace_surrender_escort` (Neltharion `Maelstrom/lost_isles.cpp:1204-1346`), and
-- the port carries tables, not scripts — so 38455 arrived with AIName '',
-- ScriptName '', zero smart_scripts and zero waypoints. He stood at Megs' elbow
-- forever, there were no naga hatchlings to march anywhere, and because nothing ever
-- summoned the Faceless of the Deep the objective could not be completed at all.
-- (There is no gossip on Ace in retail either: the escort auto-starts a few seconds
-- after the quest is accepted. "Cannot talk to him" is him being inert.)
--
-- The donor script, beat for beat:
--
--   IsSummonedBy   REACT_PASSIVE, self-root, remove 49416 from the summoner, summon
--                  4x 38457 at fixed points and MoveFollow(Ace, 0.8, 0.5/0.8/1.1/1.4 pi),
--                  then at +1s talk 0 (@+1s) and talk 1 (@+4s), face Megs, and at
--                  +6s drop the root and Start(run) down the 35-point escort path.
--   WaypointReached  13 -> talk 2 ; 20 -> talk 3
--   WaypointReached  35 -> camera shake 45849, talk 4, summon 38448 (manual) and
--                  38450 (12s) at the ruins, talk 6 at +23s, and at +25s run to
--                  (215.52, 1945.00, 0.26) — Ace legs it back up the beach.
--   Cleanup        despawn Ace and his summons when the quest completes, is
--                  abandoned, or the player walks off.
--
-- Two things are re-created here because the generator cannot see them:
--
--   * The path. npc_escortAI reads TrinityCore's `script_waypoint`, which is not one
--     of the tables `zep goblin extract-neltharion` loads — `waypoints` comes back
--     EMPTY for 38455, which reads as "no path" but is not. The 35 points below were
--     pulled straight out of `source/sql/base/world.zip` and carry the standard
--     map648 -> map1 offset (X-533.3333, Y-12800.0, Z unchanged). Cross-check: point
--     35 lands at (-364.5, -10859.4) and the shipped `quest_poi_points` objective is
--     (-401, -10861), which is the Faceless summon spot below.
--   * The two summon-only creatures. `_summons.summoned_entries()` walks spell
--     effect 28, and the donor summons these from C++, so 38457 and 38450 had no
--     `creature_template` row at all. Closed at source by `_summons.CPP_SUMMONS`.
--
-- 38455's AIName is set at source too (`creatures.AI_NAME_PORTS`) — a blank AIName
-- means SmartAI never runs and every row in this file is dead.
--
-- Divergences from the donor, both deliberate:
--   * No self-root. 38455 is MovementType 0 / REACT_PASSIVE / IMMUNE_TO_PC|NPC, so he
--     stands still on his own. The donor's root exists to stop npc_escortAI drifting;
--     re-creating it here would mean a `remove root` step that, if it ever failed,
--     reproduces exactly the bug this file fixes.
--   * No "is a Faceless already up within 80 yards" guard before the summon. SmartAI
--     has no conditional of that shape, and the cost of dropping it is a second
--     Faceless if two players reach the ruins together — both killable, both credit.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. The escort path (SmartWaypointMgr / `waypoints`, path id = the entry).
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- NOT owned by the waypoints gen domain: its scope is derived from pathIDs
-- referenced by IMPORTED SAI rows, and the ESCORT_START that uses this one is
-- hand-authored below, so a regen neither emits nor deletes these.
--
-- `SMART_ACTION_ESCORT_START` is REJECTED AT LOAD if the path is missing
-- (SmartScriptMgr.cpp:1789), and SmartWaypointMgr only loads at startup — these rows
-- must be in the DB before the worldserver comes up or the escort is silently dead.

-- 2. Ace 38455 — the escort itself.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The donor ships no smart_scripts for 38455 (its behaviour was the ScriptName), so
-- the AUTO file emits no rows and no DELETE for this entry: these ids are ours
-- outright.
--
-- The per-point callbacks are SMART_EVENT_ESCORT_REACHED (40), NOT
-- SMART_EVENT_WAYPOINT_REACHED (108) — 108 belongs to the `waypoint_data` motion
-- type. A SmartAI escort splines the whole path in one go and `SplineHandler`
-- (Unit.cpp:753) fires MovementInform per spline point, which is what advances
-- mCurrentWPID and makes the mid-path ids below fire.
--
-- ESCORT_START passes quest = 0 on purpose. A non-zero quest makes SmartAI call
-- FailQuest on the out-of-range abandon path (SmartAI.cpp:461 -> EndPath fail
-- branch); 24868 is not a failable quest and the donor only despawns its summons.
-- Ace despawning himself on abandon is SmartAI's own behaviour; row 4 catches the
-- SMART_EVENT_DEATH it fires on the way out so the hatchlings go with him.
