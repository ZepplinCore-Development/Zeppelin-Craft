-- I-320 quest 24741 "Trading Up" (Lost Isles, Raptor Rise) — world-side fixes.
--
-- SYMPTOM: no traps anywhere on the Raptor Rise, and using the Wild Clucker Eggs
-- (84311) killed nearby Spiny Raptors instead of luring one. The quest was also
-- uncompletable by any route: item 84312 "Spiny Raptor Egg" had no loot source in
-- any table.
--
-- INTENDED MECHANIC (donor: Maelstrom/lost_isles.cpp:1076,
-- npc_wild_clucker_egg_trading_up):
--   use eggs on a trap -> summon decoy 38195 at the trap marker -> decoy lures the
--   nearest Spiny Raptor (38187) in 40yd -> raptor reaches the decoy -> raptor dies,
--   decoy casts 66726 to drop lootable GO 201974 "Raptor Egg", decoy despawns.
--   No raptor in 40yd -> creature_text line 0 and despawn after 5s.
--
-- FOUR ROOT CAUSES, all fixed here or in dbc/[I-320]_spell.sql:
--   1. Trap marker 75113 was NOISE-filtered out of the port (its donor name,
--      "Wondi's Bunny - Trading Up - Spell Item Target", hits BOTH the "bunny" and
--      "wondi" tokens in creatures.py NOISE) -> no creature_template row at all, so
--      the ported condition 13/1/56576 -> 31/0/3/75113 could never resolve. Same
--      class as the I-246 marker holes; fixed at source with creatures.py NOISE_KEEP.
--   2. GO 310000 "TEMP Raptor Trap" ships displayId 0. Broken AT SOURCE — the donor
--      DB has the same row; Neltharion never finished the visible object. Fixed from
--      TDB 4.3.4 sniff data (retail 201972 "Raptor Trap", displayId 8068, stock).
--   3. Spell 56576 summoned a player guardian and summoned TWO of them — see
--      dbc/[I-320]_spell.sql.
--   4. The decoy's behaviour lived entirely in C++ -> 38195 arrived with no AIName,
--      no ScriptName and zero smart_scripts (I-310/I-311/I-312/I-313 signature).
--      Ported to SmartAI below. GO 201974 and its loot were never ported either.
--
-- Generator-first: 1 and 2 are now fixed in goblin_gen/{creatures,gameobjects}.py
-- and 201974 is in the go_scope fixture, so a regen emits the marker, its 24 spawns,
-- the trap template and the reward GO + loot. This file makes it live before that run
-- and keeps the SmartAI port (which no generator emits).
--
-- STAGING (beyond the donor, on Justin's direction): the donor's trap is an invisible
-- spell-focus and its decoy is an InvisibleStalker, so the whole set piece was
-- literally unwatchable. It is now played out with real props —
--   armed bear trap (GO 310000, jaws open)
--     -> use the eggs: a clutch of eggs appears in the jaws (GO 310001)
--     -> raptor walks in: SNAP, jaws shut, eggs gone
--     -> raptor dies in the trap
--     -> jaws open again, revealing the big Spiny Raptor Egg (GO 201974)
-- Every model and display id involved is stock 3.3.5a; nothing new ships in PATCH-Z.

-- =========================================================================
-- 1. Trap marker 75113 — template
-- =========================================================================
-- Modelled on 75042, the I-246 marker of the same donor family; the two donor rows
-- differ only in entry/name/subname/rank. unit_flags NOT_SELECTABLE (0x02000000) +
-- flags_extra TRIGGER (128) is the I-246 treatment: display 16480 is a VISIBLE
-- model, so a bare port would litter the Raptor Rise with 24 clickable bunnies.
-- After the gen run this becomes redundant with the AUTO row and can be reduced to
-- the UPDATE that sets unit_flags (the donor ships 0 there).

-- =========================================================================
-- 2. Trap marker 75113 — 24 spawns, co-located with the trap objects
-- =========================================================================
-- Positions are the live GO 310000 spawns (guids 6000231-6000254), which are the
-- donor's own 75113 spawn coords with the map648->map1 offset already applied — so
-- marker and trap sit on exactly the same point and the 5yd "am I on a trap" test
-- in the donor script is satisfied by construction. phaseMask 2048 matches both the
-- source marker spawns and the traps.
--
-- Guids are in the hand-authored [I-xxx] block (base+950000+, 11950000+) so they can
-- never collide with the sequential AUTO range or the manual_spawns fixture block.
-- The DELETE is by ENTRY, not guid, and deliberately spares this block: after the
-- generator regains ownership of 75113 it will emit its own 24 spawns on AUTO guids,
-- and this file (which sorts after the AUTO files and re-applies in the same cascade)
-- clears them so the marker count stays at 24 rather than doubling to 48. Drop this
-- whole section once the gen has run and the AUTO spawns are verified.

-- =========================================================================
-- 3. The traps themselves — a real, animated bear trap
-- =========================================================================
-- AUTO-owned row -> one consolidated UPDATE.
--
-- Built on Blizzard's own precedent for this exact mechanic: "Mammoth Trap" 188022
-- in Borean Tundra is type 1 BUTTON, size 3, Data0 1 (startOpen), Data1 0 (no
-- autoClose), AIName SmartGameObjectAI, spawned at state 0. Its sibling "Caribou
-- Trap" 187982 is the worked example of driving one from SmartAI — including
-- `action 118 SMART_ACTION_GO_SET_GO_STATE` to re-open it.
--
-- WHY THE TYPE CHANGES: type 8 SPELL_FOCUS has no GO state and therefore no
-- animation — it can only ever be a static prop. Type 1 BUTTON has two state-driven
-- poses, which is the snap. Data0 1644 / Data1 5 were the Cata SpellFocus type +
-- radius; on a BUTTON those slots are startOpen / autoCloseTime. Nothing reads the
-- old focus values — spell 56576 has spell_focus_object 0 and anchors on creature
-- 75113 via its type-13 condition, not on this GO.
--
-- STATE POLARITY — measured in-game 2026-08-08, do not "correct" it from the enum
-- names. For THIS model, GO_STATE_READY (1) renders the jaws OPEN (armed) and
-- GO_STATE_ACTIVE (0) renders them SHUT. That is the opposite of what the GOState
-- comments suggest ("ACTIVE = closed door open", GameObjectData.h:708), and the
-- first build shipped it that way and spawned every trap already snapped.
-- `startOpen` is NOT "spawn in the open position" — it is a client-side polarity
-- descriptor (GameObjectData.h:46) and the client never even receives it, since
-- Data fields are server-side only and the client gets nothing but the state byte
-- out of GAMEOBJECT_BYTES_1. So the pose is chosen by GO state and the model's own
-- authoring, full stop; the only way to pick correctly is to look at it.
-- Armed = READY also reads better server-side: READY is the resting state a GO
-- returns to, and sprung = ACTIVE is "used".
--
-- displayId 7529 is `World\Goober\G_BearTrap.mdx`, stock 3.3.5a, so no DBC row ships.
-- The PLAIN trap: one texture (SPELLS\TRAP.BLP), 7 bones, and exactly the four
-- sequences this needs — Spawn / Stand / Closed / Open. Also the display both the
-- Mammoth and Caribou traps use, so it is the precedented choice too.
--
-- Deliberately NOT 8068 `G_BearTrap_Hunter.mdx`, which is the same mesh as
-- `Spells\BearTrap.m2` byte-for-byte (identical 5-texture list, 17 bones, identical
-- Spawn/Stand/Closed/Custom0/Open set, 33104 vs 33088 bytes) but is the FREEZING
-- TRAP variant: it carries RIBBONBLUR1BEA_BLUE + SNOWFLAKE2/3 + DUST1_A emitters.
-- Frost on a tropical island — rejected 2026-08-08.

-- Beat-for-beat against the donor AI, with the staging split across the decoy and

--   use eggs on a trap  -> decoy summons GO 310001 in the middle of the trap (bait)
--                       -> 500ms later the nearest raptor in 40yd is lured in
--   raptor makes contact-> trap SNAPS SHUT (GO state 1)
--                       -> decoy despawns, taking its owned bait GO with it
--                       -> the trap takes over the rest via SET_DATA
--   +900ms              -> raptor dies in the closed trap
--   +1300ms             -> trap re-OPENS (GO state 0) and the lootable Raptor Egg
--                          appears on it
--
-- Deviations from the donor, deliberate:
--  * The donor casts SPELL_LOOK_LIKE_AN_EGG (71355) on itself. That spell is a bare
--    dummy aura whose only content is Cata SpellVisual 15099, which the 3.3.5a client
--    does not have — it would be an empty cast. Replaced by the bait GO, which is
--    what actually makes the egg visible (the decoy is an InvisibleStalker).
--  * The donor pacifies the lured raptor with a sanctuary/no-combat spell as well as
--    REACT_PASSIVE. Only the react state is ported (no such spell exists here); the
--    raptor still stops attacking and walks in.
--  * The reward chest is summoned by the TRAP, not cast by the decoy through spell
--    66726 — the decoy is gone by then. This is also strictly better: a GameObject
--    summoner fails both branches of the ownership test in Object.cpp:2433, so the
--    chest comes out UNOWNED exactly as SUMMON_OBJECT_WILD would have made it, and
--    it lands on the trap instead of GetClosePoint() beside the decoy. Spell 66726
--    stays in the DBC as ported donor data; nothing casts it.

-- Contact distance: the donor tests GetDistance(raptor) <= 1.0. SMART_EVENT_DISTANCE_CREATURE
-- measures with GetCreatureListWithEntryInGrid, which is centre-to-centre, and a raptor
-- stops at its combat reach — 3 is the equivalent "touching" threshold here.
--
-- The decoy needs no despawn backstop: spell 56576 has duration index 9 (30s), so the
-- TempSummon expires on its own if nothing at all happens.

  -- ---- the raptor's arrival handler ----
  -- ROUND 4. The two earlier "trap fires too early" rounds were both treated as timing
  -- and both made it WORSE, because the real cause is movement, not delay:
  -- every Spiny Raptor spawn is MovementType 1 RANDOM_MOTION with wander_distance 6.
  -- MOVE_TO_POS runs a PointMovementGenerator in MOTION_SLOT_ACTIVE; the moment it
  -- COMPLETES, that slot pops and the random wander generator underneath resumes — so
  -- the raptor arrives at the eggs and immediately strolls up to 6 yards back out of
  -- the trap. Every millisecond added to the fuse gave it more time to leave.
  --
  -- So: root it on arrival, and drive the whole beat off genuine arrival rather than a
  -- distance guess. SMART_EVENT_MOVEMENTINFORM (POINT_MOTION_TYPE 8, pointId 2 — the
  -- id MOVE_TO_POS was given) fires exactly when the walk-in finishes and cannot fire
  -- for anything else: the wander is RANDOM_MOTION_TYPE 1. Same shape as stock
  -- "Stampeding Caribou - On Reached Point 0 - Set Data" (25989).
  --
  -- These are direct events on creature 38187, i.e. on ALL Spiny Raptors. That is safe
