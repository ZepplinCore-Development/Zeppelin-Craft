-- I-242 "Rolling with my Homies" — homie pickup (quest 14071).
--
-- Retail shape, ported from the donor script
-- (Neltharion-Source/.../scripts/Maelstrom/kezan.cpp,
-- npc_hot_rod_controllable_vehicleAI): the roadside Ace/Izzy/Gobber are
-- KILL-CREDIT MARKERS and never leave their corners. Pressing Grab Passenger on
-- one credits the objective, summons a private rider copy into the car, and hides
-- that marker for that player alone by taking away his quest-invisibility DETECT
-- aura. Everyone else still sees him and can pick him up at the same time.
--
-- Rounds 1-5 instead had the marker itself board the car. That works solo and is
-- broken for everyone else: Unit::_ExitVehicle abandons a creature passenger where
-- it lands and nothing walks a non-evading world spawn home, so the shared spawn
-- was hogged for the whole ride and then stranded off its corner until the grid
-- reloaded (round 6). This file replaces that with the summon+aura design.
--
-- This file owns:
--   * spell_area: quest-invisibility DETECTION for the three markers while on
--     14071 (Ace 49414 type 7 / Izzy 49415 type 8 / Gobber 60921 type 9 come from
--     creature_template_addon), each gated on NOT having that homie's pickup
--     marker aura.
--   * the 62165 Spotlight beam on all three markers.
--   * smart_scripts for 34890/34892/34954 (marker pickup + rider behaviour) and
--     the three pickup-marker resets on Megs 34874.
-- The Hot Rod's own rows (34840) live in zz_[I-257]_robbing_hoods_runover.sql,
-- which owns that entry; the DELETE below still clears its retired audio rows.
-- Marker aura spells 900901-900903: dbc/[I-242]_spell.sql.

-- ---- homie visibility (spell_area, stock 74/11 "while on quest" pattern) ----
-- aura_spell is NEGATIVE = "player must NOT have this aura" (SpellMgr.cpp:1084).
-- Once a homie is picked up the row stops fitting, so UpdateArea/ZoneDependentAuras
-- both skips the autocast AND strips the detect the player already holds -- the
-- marker goes invisible for them and stays that way. Clearing the marker aura
-- (quest accept, below) re-enables the row and the autocast puts the detect back.
--
-- Coupling to know about: 49416/49417 also reveal the two Kezan pool Bilgewater
-- Buccaneers (75106 type 7, 48526 type 8) through these same rows, so a player who
-- has picked Ace/Izzy up stops seeing those two for the rest of 14071. They are
-- party props with no queststarter/questender rows, and they already vanish for
-- everybody the moment 14071 is rewarded (74/11 excludes REWARDED), so nothing
-- that is reachable at this point in the chain depends on them.

-- ---- marker + rider SmartAI (one entry serves as both) ----
-- Rows 0-2 run on the world spawn (the marker), rows 3-6 only ever run on a summon
-- (SMART_EVENT_JUST_SUMMONED never fires for a DB spawn), so both halves can share
-- one entry and the rider needs no creature_template of its own. The donor uses
-- separate entries 34957/34958/34959 for the riders; 34959 was never imported and
-- 34957/34958 are the villa questgivers with unrelated JUST_SUMMONED rows of their
-- own, so reusing this entry is both cheaper and safer here.
--
-- Row 0  credit. Invoker of the spellhit is the Hot Rod (vehicle bar spells are
--        cast by the vehicle); CALL_KILLEDMONSTER is the one action that unwraps
--        charmer -> driver (SmartScript.cpp:1187).
-- Row 1  summon the rider AT the invoker, i.e. on top of the car. 30 min timed
--        despawn is only a leash: the Hot Rod unsummons its riders on exit
--        (zz_[I-257], event 28 -> FORCE_DESPAWN on the invoker).
-- Row 2  ping the car with this homie's marker spell. The car re-casts it on its
--        charmer, which is the only exact route to the driver.
-- Row 3/4 the rider drops the marker's quest-invisibility (the driver has just
--        LOST the matching detect, so an invisible rider would be invisible to the
--        one person who must see him) and the spotlight beam.
-- Row 5  rider is unclickable, so a passer-by cannot Grab Passenger someone else's
--        rider and shortcut their own pickup.
-- Row 6  board. Closest 34840 within 15 yd is unambiguous: the rider was summoned
--        on the car, so distance is ~0 even with a second Hot Rod parked nearby.
--        46598 basepoints 0 -> seat -1 -> first free passenger seat (vehicle 448
--        has three: 4946/4947/4952 behind driver seat 4826).
