-- ============================================================
-- I-276  Shipwreck Shore arrival scene + goblin cinematic (F-011)
--
-- Second half of I-276. zz_[I-276]_lost_isles_transition.sql gets the player to
-- the beach; this file stages what happens when they land, and fires the movie
-- on the way out of Kezan.
--
-- Retail runs the scene from C++ and TrinityCore never wrote it (master's
-- src/server/scripts/Maelstrom/kezan.cpp is an empty stub), so what follows is a
-- SmartAI reconstruction. The DIALOGUE is not invented: all seven lines come
-- verbatim from the Neltharion 4.3.4 creature_text for 36608, and they describe
-- the scene exactly -- Doc spots you, calls Gizmo over, warns everyone back,
-- shocks you repeatedly, and gives up just as you come round.
--
-- Sequence: intro (groups 2, 3, 4) -> four jolts, each with a random "clear!"
-- line (group 0) -> group 5 -> aura stripped, player stands -> group 1.
-- ============================================================


-- ---- 1. Lock the player prone on arrival ---------------------------------
-- 74100 (the Life Savings teleport) triggers custom aura 900841 'Shipwrecked'
-- on hit: FEIGN_DEATH + MOD_ROOT, hidden from the buff bar. The player is held
-- down until Doc's script strips it -- the 5-minute duration on the spell is a
-- failsafe against the scene never firing, not the intended lifetime.
--
-- type 0 = SPELL_LINK_CAST: cast spell_effect when spell_trigger is cast.

-- ---- 2. Scene dialogue ---------------------------------------------------
-- Doc's seven lines and Gizmo's reply all come verbatim from the Neltharion
-- 4.3.4 creature_text. Gizmo's group 1 ("That's $n?! Sorry, Doc, I thought
-- $g he:she; was dead!") is what makes this a two-way conversation rather than
-- Doc monologuing at a silent NPC.
--
-- The only authored strings are Doc group 0 IDs 1-3, extra "clear!" variants so
-- four consecutive jolts do not repeat (creature_text picks randomly among the
-- IDs sharing a GroupID).
--
-- $n and $g substitute off the talk target. SMART_ACTION_TALK falls back to
-- GetLastInvoker() when the target list holds no player (SmartScript.cpp:227),
-- which is the arriving player -- confirmed working in-game ("That's Gobby!
-- she the only reason...").
--
-- Type 12 = CHAT_MSG_MONSTER_SAY.

-- Round 2 of this issue rewrote this gate. It used to read "14126 rewarded AND 14239 not
-- rewarded AND 14239 not taken", which sounds like a once-only gate and is
-- nothing of the sort: **quest 14239 is deliberately unwired** -- Doc has no
-- creature_queststarter and no creature_questender row, and neither does anyone
-- else -- so GetQuestStatus(14239) is QUEST_STATUS_NONE for every character
-- forever and both negative rows are permanently true. The whole gate reduced to
-- "has finished Life Savings", which every goblin past Kezan has, permanently.
--
-- Live consequence: Doc re-ran the entire resuscitation scene on any goblin who
-- came back into 20y of him -- hours later, many quests on, and after 14474 had
-- dropped the detection aura so he was not even visible while doing it. Reported
-- as "Doc was trying to zap me again when I hearthed back", and the hearth is
-- the common case because 74100 binds it to this beach.
--
-- The two gates below are the ones that actually close:
--   * NOT aura 900843 -- the Revived marker, the primary signal. Now
--     death-persistent (see the DBC file), so it survives the rest of the zone.
--     CONDITION_AURA calls HasAuraEffect(spell, effIndex) (ConditionMgr.cpp:63),
--     hence ConditionValue2 = 0 for 900843's single effect at index 0.
--   * NOT rewarded 14474 -- the same backstop the 49416 detection spell_area
--     row uses, so Doc's script and Doc's visibility stop together instead of
--     one outliving the other.

-- because a non-zero link must point at a SMART_EVENT_LINK (61) row and pointing
-- it at a plain actionlist row produces "Link Event N not found, skipped" at
-- runtime and swallows the action.
--
-- Order matters and is deliberate:
--   LAST  apply the 'Revived' marker (900843), then REMOVE 900841 explicitly,
--         then clear the stand state. BOTH aura steps are required and they do
--         different jobs:
--           * removing 900841 is what actually lifts the lock NOW;
--           * the marker is what stops spell_area putting it straight back on.
--         An earlier revision applied only the marker, on the mistaken belief
--         that Player::UpdateAreaDependentAuras re-evaluates spell_area when an
--         aura changes. It does not -- it is called on quest events
--         (PlayerQuest.cpp:599 and friends), on area change
--         (PlayerUpdates.cpp:1245) and on login (CharacterHandler.cpp:1070), but
--         never on aura application. The prone lock therefore stayed on after the
--         RP finished, and since it roots and stuns, the player could not walk to
--         another area to trigger a re-evaluation either: permanently stuck.
--
-- The quest is deliberately NOT part of this any more. Earlier revisions tried to
-- drive the prone lock off 14239's state -- granting it to start the lock, or
-- crediting an objective to end it -- and every arrangement had a flaw: an
-- auto-complete quest reads as completable the moment it is granted, so the
-- player got turn-in credit before Doc had said a word. Retail hangs the revive
-- on quest completion, but nothing we have reproduces that cleanly.
--
-- With the marker aura doing the work, the quest does not need to be load-bearing
-- at all: the RP runs, the player stands up, and 14239 goes back to being an
-- ordinary quest Doc offers afterwards. Fewer moving parts, and the timing is
-- driven by the thing that actually matters -- the scene finishing.
--   id 1  force stand state DEAD. The FEIGN_DEATH aura alone is not enough:
--         nothing server-side removes it on gossip (NPCHandler.cpp:165 only
--         strips AURA_INTERRUPT_FLAG_TALK auras, and ours has none; the
--         feign-death removal right below it is commented out), so the player
--         standing up when talking to Doc is the CLIENT playing a stand
--         animation while the aura is still applied. Stand state is a unit
--         field the server owns and the client does not override on gossip --
--         the same reason a sitting player stays seated while talking to an
--         NPC. Cleared again on hand-in by list 3660802.
--
--   NO prone row -- the lock is applied by spell_linked_spell 74100 -> 900841 at
--         the moment of the HAND-IN, so the collapse animation happens behind
--         the cinematic and the loading screen and the player is already lying
--         down when the beach fades in. Doc re-applying it on arrival was what
--         made the fall-down animation play visibly, after the movie.
--   ...   dialogue and jolts
--   NO removal row -- the aura ends on the hand-in (event 20 above), so lying
--         prone lasts as long as the player wants it to.
--
-- Doc's lines target SELF; Gizmo's reply targets SMART_TARGET_CLOSEST_CREATURE
-- (19) entry 36600 so HE is the talker. Everything aimed at the player targets
-- ACTION_INVOKER (7).
--
-- ADD_AURA (75) rather than CAST for the prone, and castFlags 2
-- (SMARTCAST_TRIGGERED) on the jolts: SMART_ACTION_CAST issues a full untriggered
-- cast (SmartScript.cpp:732) and a root/feign-death spell aimed at a FRIENDLY
-- player is refused by the target checks.

-- mistake above: an aura changing does not refresh state that is only pushed on
-- quest/area events.
--
-- The gate is unnecessary regardless. 900841 stuns the player for the whole RP,

-- resolves the ids in its own stock Movie.dbc -- 1, 2, 14, 16. Our Movie.dbc
-- ships correctly in PATCH-Z but is shadowed at runtime, so row 22 never
-- resolved and SendMovieStart(22) was silently inert. That, not the AVI, is why
-- the cinematic never played: the file itself is fine and plays with audio.
--
-- Id 16 (WOW_FoTLK) is unused, so the goblin cinematic ships as
-- `WOW_FoTLK_1024.avi` in the zep-cinematics zpak (PATCH-X) and is triggered

--

-- he was then visible to everybody. Restored here, with Doc given the same
-- treatment, and the detection granted to the player by `spell_area` instead.

-- The second row is the PRONE LOCK, and it is here rather than in Doc's scene
-- for a reason. Two earlier placements both failed:
--
--   * spell_linked_spell 74100 -> 900841 does not apply at all. It survived in
--     the file for several rounds looking plausible; removing Doc's duplicate
--     proved it had never been doing anything.
--   * SMART_ACTION_ADD_AURA inside Doc's scene DID work, but ran after the
--     player had already landed and stood up, so the collapse animation played
--     visibly, after the cinematic.
--
-- `aura_spell` = **-900843** is the release. A negative value means "applies only
-- while the player does NOT have this aura" (SpellMgr.cpp:1084). Doc applies the
-- 'Revived' marker at the end of the RP, the condition stops matching, and the
-- prone lock drops.
--
-- "Permanent" was not enough for that marker, and round 2 of this issue is the
-- bill for it. A permanent aura still dies with the player -- Unit::RemoveAllAurasOnDeath
-- (Unit.cpp:5733) strips everything non-passive that lacks
-- SPELL_ATTR3_ALLOW_AURA_WHILE_DEAD -- so the first time a goblin died anywhere,
-- the release signal was destroyed and this row started matching again. Area
-- 4721 is not the strip of sand it sounds like: ~224 map cells across four
-- tiles, about 1000x1000 yards, including the cave at (102, -9803, -12) where a
-- live character was found rooted several quests later. And 74100 binds the
-- HEARTHSTONE here, so the most common way back into the zone lands inside the
-- trigger. 900843 now carries the death-persistent attribute; see the DBC file.
--
-- Decoupling the release from quest state is what lets the quest be handed over
-- at the START of the scene, which is where it belongs. Two earlier designs did
-- not allow that: gating on 14239 being taken woke the player the instant it was
-- granted, and giving 14239 a kill-credit objective so the RP could complete it
-- modelled resuscitation as killing the medic.
--
-- `quest_end` is **14474** (round 2), not 14239. It was 14239 as a "backstop", but
-- 14239 is unwired -- nobody gives it and nobody ends it -- so
-- GetQuestStatus(14239) is QUEST_STATUS_NONE forever, bit 1 is inside mask 27,
-- and the backstop could never close. It was decoration, and it was the only
-- thing standing behind a marker aura that death deletes.
--
-- 14474 "Goblin Escape Pods" is handed in to Sassy Hardwrench, which is the real
-- end of the arrival sequence, and it is already what gates the 49416 detection
-- row directly above. Sharing it means the prone lock and the two NPCs go out of
-- scope on the same hand-in: past that point this row cannot match on any
-- character, whatever happened to their auras.
--
-- Note the release mechanism is genuinely the CONDITION ceasing to match, not a
-- removal: Player::UpdateAreaDependentAuras drops auras whose spell_area no
-- longer fits via SpellInfo::CheckLocation, so removing an aura that spell_area
-- still wants is futile -- that was the "hit by the aura randomly a couple of
-- minutes later" symptom in the first round of this issue.
--
-- spell_area applies on the area update that fires as the teleport completes --
-- the earliest data-driven hook there is -- so the collapse happens behind the
-- movie and the loading screen and the beach fades in with the player already
-- down. It also removes itself the instant 14239 is handed in, which is the
-- whole release mechanism; no timer, no SAI removal needed.


-- ---- 8. Chat-bubble probe (ANSWERED, probe removed) --------------------
-- Doc's lines reached the chat log but drew no bubble, while ambient NPCs on the
-- same client bubble fine. The leading theory was the RECEIVER GUID:
-- ChatHandler::BuildChatPacket writes one into MONSTER_SAY packets
-- (Chat.cpp:295) and SMART_ACTION_TALK always supplies one, falling back to
-- GetLastInvoker() unconditionally (SmartScript.cpp:227) -- the same GUID that
-- makes $n and $g resolve. If true, substitution and bubbles would have been
-- mutually exclusive through SmartAI TALK.
--
-- DISPROVEN. A probe line on Gizmo fired from SMART_EVENT_UPDATE_OOC -- no
-- invoker, so no receiver GUID, and no $ tokens -- reached the chat log and
-- still drew no bubble.
--
-- So the server side is conclusively clear on all three counts:
--   creature_text.Type 12 = CHAT_MSG_MONSTER_SAY   (SharedDefines.h:3433)
--   TEXT_RANGE_NORMAL -> SendMessageToSetInRange   (CreatureTextMgr.cpp:363)
--   receiver GUID ruled out by the probe above
-- Chat bubbles are a CLIENT concern -- the `chatBubbles` CVar, ElvUI's
-- per-character Chat Bubbles Style, or another addon. Nothing to fix in data.
