-- I-312 "Up, Up & Away!" (quest 14244) — Sling Rocket (36505) never launches.
--
-- SYMPTOM: player takes the quest from Sassy Hardwrench (36425), clicks the
-- Rocket Sling GO (196439), is seated in the rocket — and the rocket just sits
-- on the launcher forever. No flight, no credit, no way out but /unstuck.
--
-- ROOT CAUSE: everything the rocket does lived in C++, not in data. The donor
-- dump implements it as `npc_sling_rocket` (VehicleAI subclass,
-- Maelstrom/lost_isles.cpp:996) — root on summon, unroot + flight-speed + a
-- 9-point MoveSmoothPath 600 ms after the player boards, then eject + credit on
-- the last node. The F-011 port carries data only, so 36505 arrived with NO
-- AIName and NO waypoints: the boarding half works (see below) and the flying
-- half does not exist. Replaced with SmartAI here, same shape as the I-311
-- cyclone.
--
-- Why boarding already works (not a bug, recorded so it is not "fixed" later):
-- 68804 "Summon Sling Rocket - Character" is a SUMMON_CATEGORY_VEHICLE summon
-- whose effect value names the ride spell (68805). The port's +1 die-sides drift
-- (see the I-277 note) makes CalcValue return 68806, which does not resolve, so
-- AC falls back to VEHICLE_SPELL_RIDE_HARDCODED (46598). Vehicle 524 has one
-- seat (6026) either way, so the drift is inert here — left alone deliberately.
--
-- Flight path altitudes are DERIVED, not the donor's raw z: the donor path is in
-- map-648 space and was transformed X-533.3333 / Y-12800 (see the F-011 offset
-- note), then re-sampled against the shipped heightmap with
-- `cli/lib/terrain_reader.py`. Minimum clearance en route is 32 yd (node 8) and
-- the arc peaks 239 yd over the sea floor, so the donor's shape is kept verbatim
-- apart from the landing node.

-- ---- template: give the rocket an AI ----
-- AUTO-owned row -> one consolidated UPDATE.
-- SmartAI replaces the default VehicleAI; nothing in VehicleAI is needed here
-- (the rocket is auto-piloted and despawns itself), same trade as 36178 in I-311.

-- fall-damage threshold — and 24 yd from ender Foreman Dampwick (36470).

-- ---- SmartAI: idle on the launcher -> fly on boarding -> credit + despawn ----
-- Launch is deferred 600 ms through a timed actionlist exactly as the donor does
-- (EVENT_SLING_ROCKET_1 @ 600), so the client has finished seating the player
-- before the spline starts and the ride does not visibly snap.
-- Speed/flight come from stock 54421 "Flight" (SPELL_AURA_FLY + aura 206
-- SPELL_AURA_MOD_INCREASE_FLIGHT_SPEED @ +100%), the same spell the donor casts:
-- it doubles speed_flight 3.5 -> 7.0 (~49 yd/s, ~9 s for the 426 yd arc) AND
-- guarantees MOVEMENTFLAG_CAN_FLY so the escort splines fly instead of trying to
-- path over the sea floor. No creature_template_addon fly aura is added — that
-- is only needed for PLAYER-driven vehicles (seat 6026 has no CAN_CONTROL).
-- Credit + eject are armed on BOTH the last waypoint (40) and path end (58).
-- Reaching node 9 calls EndPath immediately after, so in the normal case both
-- fire; CALL_KILLEDMONSTER is idempotent for a count-1 objective and the second
-- FORCE_DESPAWN lands on an already-despawning creature, so the redundancy is
-- free insurance against either hook being skipped.
