-- [I-238] Give idle hostile mobs (npcflag=0, MovementType=0) a random wander radius so they
-- don't stand motionless. Static NPCs (gossip/questgiver/trainer/vendor) stay put.
-- Override for the generated spawn files; loads after them (I > F).
-- PREFERRED long-term fix: set wander for idle hostiles in the spawn generator (migrate_creatures),
-- then retire this override.
--
-- Posed / corpse spawns are excluded (sliding-corpse regression, reported on Goblin
-- Survivor 38409 guid 11002046): a random-wander motion master drags the body across
-- the ground while it keeps its dead/kneeling/sitting pose. Neltharion stages those
-- three ways, so all three are checked:
--   * per-spawn `dynamicflags` 0x20 UNIT_DYNFLAG_DEAD
--   * a non-zero stand state (byte 0 of `bytes1`: 1 sit / 7 dead / 8 kneel / ...) on
--     either the per-guid `creature_addon` or the entry's `creature_template_addon`
--   * aura 29266 Permanent Feign Death, which lays the body down on its own even when
--     the stand state is 0 (gen unions template auras into the per-guid rows)
-- Dedicated corpse entries exist alongside their live twins and differ only in this
-- data: 35929 Poison Spitter (corpse) vs 35896 (live), 361760 Alliance Sailor (corpse)
-- vs 36176 (live).

-- 0. Restore idle poses that a per-guid `creature_addon` silently cancelled.
--
-- `Creature::GetCreatureAddon()` (Creature.cpp:2730) returns the guid-keyed row
-- INSTEAD of the template row — the two are never merged. The gen's tdb434 overlay
-- emits a per-guid addon for pose/movement sampling and leaves `emote` at 0, so any
-- entry whose idle pose lives on `creature_template_addon.emote` loses it outright
-- for those spawns. Same shape as the aura clobber the gen already fixes by unioning
-- template auras into every per-guid row — `emote` was never included in that union.
--
-- Must run BEFORE the wander grant below, so the grant can see the restored pose and
-- skip it.
