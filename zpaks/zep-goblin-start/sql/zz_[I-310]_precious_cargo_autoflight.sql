-- I-310 round 5: the Precious Cargo (14242) Gyrochoppa flies itself.
--
-- Same shape as the two Bastia rides (I-349) and the same donor pattern: the whole ride
-- was a C++ script the port never carried — npc_gyro_precious_cargo_vehicle,
-- Neltharion lost_isles.cpp:721 — so 36143 shipped as a chopper you had to pilot.
-- The donor: passive + rooted on summon, MoveSmoothPath GyroCargoPath[12] 1500 ms after
-- the player boards, and at the last point a camera shake, an explosion, a whisper, then
-- eject and despawn — it CRASHES next to the Vengeance Wake, it does not land.
--
-- Generator side (already landed, so a re-run keeps this working):
--   * creatures.py AI_NAME_PORTS += 36143 -> SmartAI (the donor template's AIName is
--     empty; its behaviour WAS the ScriptName, and a blank AIName means these rows never
--     run). Also takes it off the I-313 "donor C++ not ported" WARN.
--
-- Seat 5706 loses VEHICLE_SEAT_FLAG_CAN_CONTROL (0x800) in dbc/[I-310]_vehicleseat.sql,
-- which owns that row: Vehicle::AddPassenger (Vehicle.cpp:433) charms the vehicle when a
-- PLAYER takes a control seat, and SmartAI::UpdateAI early-returns while
-- !IsAIControlled(), so an AI-driven path on a control seat never moves. Round 4's two
-- reasons for adopting the Oculus drake profile are untouched: CAN_ENTER_OR_EXIT
-- 0x2000000 (the SERVER checks it in HandleRequestVehicleExit) and CAN_CAST 0x20000000
-- (the vehicle bar, hence the Leave Vehicle button — the core serves that bar on
-- cast-capable seats without CAN_CONTROL too, Vehicle.cpp:454, I-311).
--
-- Round 2's flight recipe still does the work: creature_template_movement Flight=1 makes
-- Creature::CanFly() true, so WaypointMovementGenerator::StartMove calls init.SetFly() on
-- every leg, and the addon aura 59553 is what reaches the client. SET_FLY below adds the
-- DisableGravity that keeps the chopper from sagging between waypoints.
--
-- `waypoints` (SmartWaypointMgr), NOT `waypoint_data` — action 53 resolves pathID through
-- the former only, and it has NO reload command: worldserver restart, not
-- `.reload smart_scripts`.

-- ============================================================
-- 1. The flight
-- ============================================================
-- GyroCargoPath[12] verbatim, map 648 -> map 1 (X-533.3333, Y-12800.0, Z unchanged).
-- 968 yd; at speed_flight 3.0 (round 3, ~21 yd/s) that is about 46 s in the air.
--
-- Sampled against our heightmap (cli/lib/terrain_reader.py, map 1): point 1 is +3.6 over
-- the beach beside the parked chopper 36127 (5.8 yd away), and every later point is 12 to
-- 88 yd over an ocean floor that falls to -33. A real flight path, unlike the Bastia
-- ground runs — which is why this one keeps the flight recipe.
--
-- The last point (438.35, -8996.69, 14.74) is ~15 yd above the water and 53 yd from the
-- precious cargo 36145, i.e. the crash site beside the Vengeance Wake. The rider is
-- dropped there on purpose. Note the core's dismount parachute (VEHICLE_SPELL_PARACHUTE
-- 45472, Vehicle.cpp:560) DOES fire here because the chopper is flying — which is correct
-- for a crash at altitude and is why it is not stripped the way I-343 strips it.

-- ============================================================
-- 2. Gyrochoppa 36143
-- ============================================================
-- Rooting is dropped: MovementType is 0 (idle) and the react state is passive, so the
-- chopper holds position until the escort starts and SET_ROOT would need a second row to
-- undo it. `target_type` 1 (SELF) on ESCORT_START keeps the player out of
-- SMART_ESCORT_TARGETS, so the escort never waits on or paces itself to the rider.
--
-- Deliberately NOT ported from the donor:
--   * `summoner->RemoveAura(49416)` in IsSummonedBy. 49416 is Generic Quest Invisibility
--     Detection 1, and on this server it is granted by the round-1 spell_area row that
--     makes the choppas visible in the first place — Player::UpdateAreaDependentAuras
--     would put it straight back, and stripping it is a way to hide NPCs the rider may
--     still need. Whatever the donor wanted it for, it is not safe to copy here.
--   * `RemoveFlag(UNIT_NPC_FLAGS, UNIT_NPC_FLAG_SPELLCLICK)` before the despawn — it stops
--     the wreck being re-clicked in the 100 ms before it disappears. Nothing to port.

-- ============================================================
-- 3. The re-fly gossip is beach-only now
-- ============================================================
-- Round 4 added the "Fire up the Gyrochoppa!" option (menu 510033, gated 14242 REWARDED
-- + 14445 not rewarded) and a second parked 36127 on the Wake's deck so a rider stranded
-- on the boat could summon a chopper again. That option casts the SAME 68386 and summons
-- the SAME 36143, so with the run now on rails it flies the one-way beach -> ship path
-- wherever you board it. From the beach clicker that is exactly right. From the deck it is
-- a ~1500 yd round trip: deck, back to the beach start, out to the ship again, ending
-- where it began.
--
-- The option is therefore hidden on the boat. Keyed on the AREA, not on the deck spawn's
-- guid: 4783 "Alliance Beachhead" is the beach, 4784 "Vengeance Wake" is the deck, the
-- crash point and the cargo 36145 — one area covering the whole ship, so a NEGATIVE match
-- on 4784 hides it everywhere on the boat and nowhere else. Guid-keyed overrides in the
-- 11xxxxxx band are the thing that rots (I-318), and this needs no guid at all.
--
-- The deck 36127 stays: it is still the parked prop that tells you where the choppa
-- lives, it just no longer offers a ride. The designed way off the boat is unchanged —
-- 68408's Cyclone of the Elements on 14243 accept.
--
-- The two AUTO-owned rows for this option (14242 REWARDED, 14445 NOT) are untouched; this
-- is an additional AND in the same ElseGroup, and zz_[AUTO,F-011]_70_conditions.sql sorts
-- before this file so the group-wide DELETE up there always runs first.
