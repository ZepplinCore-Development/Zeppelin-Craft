-- I-344 "Do it Yourself" (14070) — beat-down credit for the four Kezan foremen.
--
-- Symptom: a player beats Jack the Hammer (34877) down, he gives up and
-- despawns, and objective 3 never ticks. Bruno/Frankie/Sudsy usually credit.
--
-- Root cause is an ordering race in the ported surrender chain, not a data
-- defect: every column of 34877 matches its three siblings and the Neltharion
-- donor. Each foreman gets SMART_ACTION_SET_INVINCIBILITY_HP_LEVEL(0, 1%) on
-- aggro, so he can never be killed and pins at 1 HP; SMART_EVENT_HEALTH_PCT
-- (0..1) then calls his timed actionlist, which ran in donor order:
--
--   0  SET_FACTION 35        <- creature becomes friendly
--   1  CAST 88467 Sanctuary  <- SPELL_EFFECT_SANCTUARY, drops combat outright
--   2  (+1s) TALK 1
--   3  CALL_KILLEDMONSTER <entry>, target PLAYER_DISTANCE 35
--   4  FORCE_DESPAWN 4000
--
-- Steps 0-1 end combat, so the creature evades and runs MoveTargetedHome().
-- Creature::Update (Creature.cpp:880) skips UpdateAI() for the whole time
-- IsInEvadeMode() is true, which freezes SmartScript::OnUpdate and therefore
-- the rest of the actionlist. The credit at step 3 is a 35-yard sweep around
-- the CREATURE, evaluated after that walk — so whether the player is paid
-- depends on how far the foreman was pulled from his spawn and on how far the
-- player is standing when the list thaws. Miss the window and step 4 despawns
-- him with no credit and no way to retry until he respawns.
--
-- Fix: hand out the credit FIRST, while the player is still engaged and in
-- range, then drop combat. Same actions, same 35-yard retail sweep, no race.
--
-- Live evidence (char 102, mid-session): quest 14070 INCOMPLETE with
-- mobcount 1/1/0/1 while creature_respawn already held Jack's spawn guid
-- 12000158 — he had completed his despawn without paying the objective.
--
-- Second defect (same content, reported later): "one player beats them and they
-- do not appear for the next player." FORCE_DESPAWN was emitted with
-- forceRespawnTimer = 0, so the foreman fell back to the spawn row's respawn
-- delay. The F-011 generator stamps a blanket spawntimesecs = 300 on every Kezan
-- creature (1142 of 1143 rows), and Creature::setDeathState(JustDied) adds the
-- rank-0 corpse decay on top, so each foreman was gone for 300 + 60 = 360 s.
-- Measured on the live server: guid 12000125 despawned ~1787964286, its
-- creature_respawn row read 1787964646; guid 12000159 despawned ~1787964319,
-- row read 1787964679. Exactly 360 s both times.
--
-- There is one spawn of each foreman and no per-player phasing, so a second
-- player arriving behind the first waits six minutes per objective. Fix:
-- FORCE_DESPAWN action_param2 = 30 (forceRespawnTimer, seconds). SmartScript
-- passes it to Creature::DespawnOrUnsummon, which overrides m_respawnDelay
-- before setDeathState so the corpse delay is not added. The spawn row's 300 s
-- is untouched — this only shortens the beat-down path, and it lives here
-- rather than in the AUTO gen creature file.
