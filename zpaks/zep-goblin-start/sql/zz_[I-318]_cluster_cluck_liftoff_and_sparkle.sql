-- I-318 : Cluster Cluck (q24671) - the Wild Clucker behaviour set.
--
-- Covers, in order: the interact sparkle (removed with the whole spellclick path),
-- the capture sequence (lift off before flying to the coop), and ambient wander
-- (the birds never moved at all before being captured).
--
-- The sparkle was invisible until the visual chain was ported (same issue): it is
-- `particles\lootfx.mdx`, carried by SpellVisual 15092, which rendered nothing
-- before spellvisuals.py started emitting it.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. Cluster Cluck is item-only: no click interaction, no sparkle at all.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The quest hands out an item ("Take these remote control fireworks and attach
-- them to the cluckers"), and the birds are ordinary selectable creatures, so the
-- spellclick path is redundant with the item path: both ended in the same place,
-- creature 38111 SPELLHIT 71170 -> actionlist 3811100. Dropping it removes the
-- whole sparkle apparatus rather than repairing it.
--
-- What the sparkle was and why it had to go:
--   * On the BIRDS it comes from `creature_template_addon` aura 66727 (plus 8
--     per-guid rows), permanent and identical for every observer. It cannot be
--     gated on quest state - a creature's ambient aura has no per-player variant -
--     so it kept shimmering long after turn-in. Retail hides them by phasing the
--     zone forward instead; all 65 spawns here sit in phaseMask 2048.
--   * On the PLAYER it was a real bug: `cast_flags` carried
--     NPC_CLICK_CAST_CASTER_CLICKER (0x1) from the donor, so AC resolved
--         Unit* caster = (castFlags & NPC_CLICK_CAST_CASTER_CLICKER) ? clicker : this;
--     and 66727 applies its aura to TARGET_UNIT_CASTER (1) - the permanent shimmer
--     landed on the clicking player and was SAVED to `character_aura`
--     (remainTime -1), surviving relogs. Existing victims need `.unaura 66727`;
--     SQL cannot reach an aura already on a character.
--
-- npcflag 16777216 (SPELLCLICK) is cleared too, so the client stops offering an
-- interact cursor for a click that no longer exists. Selectability is unaffected -
-- unit_flags 32768 is UNIT_FLAG_SWIMMING, not NOT_SELECTABLE (0x02000000) - so the
-- bird can still be targeted for the item.
--
-- Leaves creature 38111's two ON_SPELLCLICK SAI rows (ids 1 and 8) in place. With
-- no npcflag and no spellclick row, HandleSpellClick never runs and they are inert;
-- forking the whole 9-row block to delete two dead rows would freeze the escort
-- rows (which reference GO guid 106846) against future regens for no gain.

UPDATE creature_template_addon SET auras = '' WHERE entry = 38111;

-- runs: a regen on 2026-08-08 moved the eight aura-carrying addon rows from
-- 11001802/11/12/26/27/45/46/54 to 11001825/34/35/49/50/68/69/77, and the hardcoded
-- list this replaces then cleared eight rows that no longer existed while the
-- sparkle came back on eight birds. `creature_addon` is emitted with REPLACE, so the

-- yet - fixed here rather than left as a landmine for the next PATCH-Z. The

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2. Captured cluckers walked off instead of rocketing up.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Full re-definition of timed actionlist 3811100 (the imported one is otherwise
-- kept beat for beat). Two changes to the source ordering:
--
--   * Flight (57403) is cast BEFORE the bird is asked to move, not after. The
--     import cast it at entry 5, two steps after the movement call.
--   * a vertical MOVE_TO_POS replaces nothing and is inserted before WP_START, so
--     the rocket carries the bird ~8 yards straight up first; the 2s that already
--     preceded the escort now covers the climb, and only then does it turn for the
--     coop. Previously the bird idled on the spot for 2s and then ran the escort
--     path at ground level, which is what "the motion seems weird" was.
--
-- MOVE_TO_POS (69) with target_type 1 (SELF) uses target_x/y/z as an OFFSET from
-- the creature's own position (SmartScript.cpp, the `default:` branch of the
-- action), so target_z = 8 is "8 yards above wherever this bird was clicked" - it
-- works for all 65 spawns without per-spawn coordinates. action_param6 = 0 leaves
-- disableForceDestination unset, i.e. forceDestination TRUE, so the climb is not
-- re-clamped to the ground by pathfinding.
--
-- The escort path itself (`waypoints` entry 38111 -> the coop, then ESCORT_REACHED
-- rows 3-7 on creature 38111 activate GO 106846 and despawn) is unchanged.
-- The authoritative definition of actionlist 3811100 is the single DELETE +
-- INSERT at the end of section 5 - it carries the final state including the
-- SET_FLY and emote-state beats added later. One representation per id: this
-- section describes the design, section 5 is where the rows live.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 3. The cluckers never wandered - a one-shot MoveIdle was killing it.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Imported SAI row (38111, source_type 0, id 0) is verbatim donor:
--
--     event 1 UPDATE_OOC, event_flags 1, action 89 RANDOM_MOVE, action_param1 0
--     comment: " Random move"
--
-- The comment states the intent, but AC reads a zero distance as the OPPOSITE:
--
--     if (e.action.moveRandom.distance) MoveRandom(distance); else MoveIdle();
--
-- so the row calls `MoveIdle()`. `event_flags 1` is SMART_EVENT_FLAG_NOT_REPEATABLE,
-- so it fires exactly once on the first out-of-combat update after spawn and
-- replaces the RandomMovementGenerator with an idle one - permanently. Every bird
-- stood perfectly still, which is why strapping a rocket to one looked so odd.
--
-- This is a donor/AC semantic divergence, not a lost value: the source row really
-- does carry 0. It is a one-off - of the 14 rows in the world with
-- action_type 89 / action_param1 0, the other 13 are stock AC content whose
-- comments show they genuinely mean "stop moving" (Karu, Zulian Crocolisk, Brann,
-- the Swine, ...), so there is nothing here to generalise into the generator.
-- Deleting the row lets the spawn-level movement config do its job. No other row
-- links to id 0, so removing it does not disturb the escort chain.
DELETE FROM smart_scripts WHERE source_type = 0 AND entryorguid = 38111 AND id = 0;

-- The donor has all 65 spawns at MovementType 0; the generator's TDB 4.3.4 wander
-- overlay granted MovementType 1 / wander_distance 10 to only 52 of them, and that
-- overlay is non-deterministic (its `tdb_q` has no ORDER BY), so the split moves
-- between regens. Normalising the whole entry is therefore both the fix for the 13
-- stragglers and self-healing against a future gen run redrawing the line.
--
-- wander_distance is the "how far do they roam" knob, and it is the RIGHT one for
-- that question - speed is not, because speed drives the animation rate (see
-- section 6). 4 yards keeps the birds pottering around their spawn instead of
-- striding across Kezan, at an unchanged, native-rate walk.
UPDATE creature SET MovementType = 1, wander_distance = 4 WHERE id = 38111;

-- Capture still stops the wander before lift-off: actionlist 3811100 id 2 is
-- RANDOM_MOVE 0, i.e. the very MoveIdle described above - which is exactly what it
-- is for in that context.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 4. ...but they wandered through the AIR, because the bird had no ground mode.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The donor's `creature_template.InhabitType` for 38111 is 4 (air only), and
-- immunities_movement.py maps those bits straight to Ground/Swim/Flight, giving
-- Ground = 0 (CreatureGroundMovementType::None) and Flight = 1 (DisableGravity).
-- A creature with Ground = None has no ground movement at all, so the moment
-- section 3 turned wandering on, 65 chickens drifted around in the air.
--
-- It never showed before because the MoveIdle row froze them on the spot, which
-- is presumably why the donor never noticed either.
--
-- BUSHCHICKEN.M2 settles what it should be: 18 animations, none of them flight —
-- Stand / Walk / Run / Jump / Fall / Swim / AttackUnarmed. A flying clucker has no
-- anim to play and glides in its Stand pose. It is a ground bird that gets a rocket
-- strapped to it, not a flyer.
--
-- Flight must NOT go to 0. `Creature::UpdateMovementFlags` strips the flag when the
-- template forbids flight:
--
--     if (GetMovementTemplate().IsFlightAllowed() && isInAir && !IsFalling()) { ... }
--     else { if (m_movementInfo.HasMovementFlag(MOVEMENTFLAG_CAN_FLY)) SetCanFly(false); ... }
--
-- and `IsFlightAllowed()` is `Flight != None`, so Flight = 0 would undo the
-- SetCanFly(true) that capture spell 57403 (SPELL_AURA_FLY) applies, breaking the
-- lift-off. Flight = 2 (CanFly) instead: while the bird is on the ground `isInAir`
-- is false, so the else branch keeps it walking with no fly flags, and once the
-- rocket takes it up the same branch that would have stripped the flag now
-- maintains it.
--
-- (Superseded by section 5 - Flight = 2 turned out to be wrong for a different
-- reason. The single authoritative UPDATE is in "Final state" at the end.)

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 5. Walk on the ground; fly (and hold SwimIdle) only once rocketed.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Section 4's Ground=1/Flight=2 stopped short: `Creature::CanFly()` is
--
--     bool CanFly() const override { return GetMovementTemplate().IsFlightAllowed() || IsFlying(); }
--
-- so ANY non-zero Flight makes CanFly() true even while the bird is stood on the
-- ground. `UpdateAllowedPositionZ` then never clamps the wander destination to the
-- terrain, and the random movement generator picks points in the air - the birds
-- swam around the sky. (The client falls back to the swim anims for a flying model
-- with no flight sequences, which is what that looked like: BUSHCHICKEN.M2 has
-- Stand / Walk / Run / Jump / Fall / Swim and no Fly* at all.)
--
-- Flight must therefore be 0 for a grounded wander. But Flight 0 alone breaks the
-- capture, twice over:
--   * `SetCanFly()` only sets MOVEMENTFLAG_CAN_FLY, while `IsFlying()` tests
--     MOVEMENTFLAG_FLYING | DISABLE_GRAVITY - so capture spell 57403 (aura 201)
--     leaves CanFly() false and the climb would be re-clamped to the ground; and
--   * `UpdateMovementFlags` strips CAN_FLY and DISABLE_GRAVITY on every update when
--     `IsFlightAllowed()` is false.
--
-- Hence all three of:
--   * Flight 0 / Ground 1 (Run)          - walks while idle, wander clamps to terrain
--   * flags_extra |= 0x200               - CREATURE_FLAG_EXTRA_NO_MOVE_FLAGS_UPDATE,
--                                          so UpdateMovementFlags returns early and
--                                          stops undoing the capture state
--   * SMART_ACTION_SET_FLY (60) at capture - SmartAI::SetFly -> SetCanFly(true) AND
--                                          setFly.disableGravity -> SetDisableGravity(true),
--                                          which is what actually makes IsFlying()
--                                          (and so CanFly()) true for the climb.

-- Actionlist rebuilt with the two new beats. SET_FLY (60) params are
-- fly / speed / disableGravity per the struct (the header comment is "0/1" only).
-- SET_EMOTE_STATE (17) writes UNIT_NPC_EMOTESTATE; emote 437 STATE_SWIM_IDLE is the
-- one that maps to AnimationData 41 SwimIdle, with EmoteSpecProc 2 (a looping state),
-- so the airborne bird holds that pose instead of falling back to Stand. It is never
-- cleared because the bird despawns at the coop.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 6. The shipped M2 lied about its Walk speed. That was the whole problem.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The client scales locomotion playback by (actual speed / the pace the SEQUENCE
-- SAYS it was authored for), and the shipped model was carrying a false figure:
--
--     BushChicken.M2, anim 4 Walk, moveSpeed at sequence-record offset 8
--       4.3.4 original      0.3611 yd/s
--       our shipped v264    2.5000 yd/s   <- exactly baseMoveSpeed[MOVE_WALK]
--
-- Only Walk; Run agrees at 4.1667 in both. Someone or something "normalised" the
-- field to AC's default walk speed. 2.5 / 0.3611 = 6.9, so at the speed that field
-- demanded the bird covered nearly SEVEN times the ground its legs were drawn for:
-- "anim playing super slow but movement is too fast", and a model viewer showing
-- the cycle far quicker than the game.
--
-- Every earlier attempt to tune this was chasing the lie. speed_walk 1.0 gave
-- ratio 1.0 against the false 2.5 - native cycle rate, seven times too much ground.
-- Dropping to 0.25 fixed the ground and visibly slowed the legs (ratio 0.25),
-- because the ratio is what drives playback.
--
-- Fixed at the source: the Walk moveSpeed in
-- `mpq/{source,parsed}-assets/.../bushchicken.m2` is patched back to the 4.3.4
-- value, bytes copied verbatim from the original rather than retyped (backups
-- alongside as *.pre-I318.bak). With the field honest, the matching server speed is
--
--     0.3611111 / 2.5 (baseMoveSpeed[MOVE_WALK]) = 0.144444
--
-- which gives ratio 1.0: native cycle rate AND the stride the animation actually
-- depicts. Ships in PATCH-Z; the DBC/MPQ half and the SQL half must land together.
--
-- WITH THE FIELD HONEST, SPEED BECOMES A FREE KNOB. Playback rate is
-- (speed / authored), so the cycle lasts 1000ms * authored / speed and the ground
-- covered per cycle is
--
--     speed * cycle = speed * (1000ms * authored / speed) = 1000ms * authored
--                   = 0.3611 yards, INVARIANT at every speed
--
-- The feet therefore cannot slide again whatever value is chosen - lowering the
-- speed slows the legs and the body together and the two stay locked. That is only
-- true because the authored figure now matches the art; while it was the false 2.5,
-- every change to speed desynced them, which is what made sections 7-9 unwinnable.
--
-- Native rate (0.3611 yd/s) read as too brisk in game, so the cadence is halved:
-- speed_walk 0.072222 -> 0.1806 yd/s, 0.50x rate, a 2000ms cycle, same 0.3611 yd
-- stride. Purely taste now; scale it freely (0.048148 = a third, 0.036111 = a
-- quarter) without touching the model.
--
-- Which anim plays is `creature_template_movement.Random`, read by
-- `RandomMovementGenerator` to set the spline's walk flag:
--
--     case CreatureRandomMovementType::CanRun:    walk = creature->IsWalking(); break;
--     case CreatureRandomMovementType::AlwaysRun: walk = false;                 break;
--
-- Random stays 0 (Walk) - the Walk sequence is the one that was mis-declared and is
-- now correct. Run was always honest, so Random = 2 with speed_run = 0.595238
-- (4.1667/7.0) remains a valid alternative; it needs
-- `.reload creature_movement_override`, because a per-spawn cache shadows the
-- template (`Creature::GetMovementTemplate` checks
-- `GetCreatureMovementOverride(m_spawnId)` first) and `.reload creature_template`
-- does not refresh it.
--
-- speed_run stays at the donor 1.0 - unused while the wander walks (Random 0 means
-- ground movement takes MOVE_WALK), so MOVE_RUN belongs entirely to the capture
-- flight and the actionlist sets it explicitly at both stages. See section 8.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 8. The flight speed must come from the TEMPLATE, not a forced SetSpeed.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The climb reads as a quick rocket and the trip to the coop as a crawl. The
-- distance explains part of it - the climb is 8 yards, while the escort path is
-- FIXED near the coop (`waypoints` entry 38111 starts at 394, -10467) and the 65
-- spawns spread from x 313-496 / y -10432 to -10541, so a bird captured at the far
-- edge covers well over a hundred yards to reach point 1.
--
-- Which speed governs it is not the obvious one:
--
--     UnitMoveType MovementInfo::GetSpeedType(uint32 moveFlags)
--     { if (moveFlags & MOVEMENTFLAG_FLYING) return MOVE_FLIGHT; ... return MOVE_RUN; }
--
-- keys on MOVEMENTFLAG_FLYING (0x02000000), which the header itself notes is
-- "only used for players. creatures use disable_gravity". SET_FLY gives CAN_FLY
-- (0x01000000) and DISABLE_GRAVITY (0x400), so the test never matches and both legs
-- take **MOVE_RUN**. `speed_flight` (0.5) is never consulted despite the bird being
-- airborne - tuning it would do nothing.
--
-- A first attempt ramped MOVE_RUN with SET_FLY's speed param
-- (`SetSpeed(MOVE_RUN, speed / 100.0f, true)`) between the climb and ESCORT_START.
-- It did not take. A forced SetSpeed only holds until something calls
-- `Unit::UpdateSpeed(MOVE_RUN)`, which recomputes from scratch and ends with
--
--     speed *= ToCreature()->GetCreatureTemplate()->speed_run;
--
-- and the capture chain applies auras (57403 carries 201/37/206) that do exactly
-- that. So the value has to live in the template where the recomputation lands:
-- speed_run 1 -> 3 gives MOVE_RUN 21 yd/s, three times player run speed, for both
-- the climb and the flight. The SET_FLY rows now pass 0 as the speed param, which
-- skips the forced call entirely.
--
-- Spline clamp is not in the way:
--     min(velocity, catmullrom || flying ? 50.0 : max(28.0, GetSpeed(MOVE_RUN) * 4.0))
-- = max(28.0, 84.0) = 84 at this rate.
--
-- Side effect accepted: MOVE_RUN is also what a fleeing critter uses, so an attacked
-- clucker bolts at 21 yd/s. They are passive level 1 critters that no longer give
-- kill credit (section 9), so nothing hangs on it. The ground wander is unaffected -
-- Random 0 means it takes MOVE_WALK.

-- 9. Killing a clucker must not count as capturing it.

-- The donor sets `creature_template.KillCredit1 = 38117` on 38111, and the port
-- carried it verbatim. That is a SECOND, independent credit path: AC's
-- `Player::KilledMonster` follows KillCredit1/2 on death, so simply killing a bird
-- ticked the objective. The birds are level 1 critters, so that is the easiest way
-- to finish the quest and it bypasses the fireworks entirely.
--
-- The capture credit does not come from this field - it comes from the actionlist
-- (3811100 id 1, CALL_KILLEDMONSTER 38117 on the action invoker), so clearing
-- KillCredit1 costs nothing and closes the shortcut. Checked for other death paths
-- first: creature 38111 has no JUST_DIED (event 6) SAI row, so this was the only one.
--
-- Folded into the consolidated creature_template UPDATE above rather than appended
-- as its own statement - one UPDATE per row id.
